# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Color Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS where the background color of a div element is not rendered as expected.  The code uses the `bg-gray-100` class to set a light gray background, but the actual rendered color is different.

## Bug Description

A `div` element styled with Tailwind CSS's `bg-gray-100` class is not displaying the correct light gray background color. The issue appears to be related to unexpected CSS conflicts or improper configuration.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for conflicting CSS rules that might override the `bg-gray-100` class.  This could be caused by other stylesheets, inline styles, or issues with the Tailwind CSS configuration itself.  The solution provided verifies the Tailwind configuration and CSS specificity to ensure the correct color is applied.
